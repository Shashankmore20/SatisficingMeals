## Project Objective

SatisficingMeals solves the problem of uninspiring meals, busy weeknights, and food waste by helping users track what's in their pantry, when items expire, and recipes they can make. Users add items to their virtual pantry - the system suggests expiry dates automatically. The dashboard highlights items expiring soon so nothing goes to waste.
The app goes beyond tracking. It suggests meals you can make with what you already have and generates a grocery list. It tracks leftovers with portion counts, suggests ingredient substitutions, and sends reminders for ingredient prep (like marinating tomorrow's chicken or setting pizza dough out to rise).
Users can look up unfamiliar ingredients via Wikipedia to learn what they are and where they grow. The app also tracks purchase history to show frequently bought items and smart suggestions.
